	Hey,

	This is a friendly reminder that a book your borrowing is due tomorrow. 

	Don't worry, you'll be able to keep the book in the meantime. 

	This just means you will need to reshare the book at sharebookqut.com.au.

	When a student borrows the book, you will need to have the book ready for collection at the specified pickup time and location.


	If you have any questions, please reply to this email.
